## Introduction

This project is a personal endeavor to build a simple blockchain from the ground up using Go. The primary goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the core concepts and mechanics behind blockchain technology, such as blocks, transactions, consensus algorithms, and cryptographic hashing.

## Features

- **Block Creation**: Create new blocks containing transactions.
- **Transaction Handling**: Add transactions to blocks.
- **Proof of Work**: Implement a simple Proof of Work consensus algorithm.
- **Blockchain Verification**: Verify the integrity of the blockchain.
- **Serialization**: Serialize and deserialize blocks for storage and transmission.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Go installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
